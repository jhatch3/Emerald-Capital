## RECORDING TIPS

### For Screen Recording:
1. **Resolution**: Record at 1920x1080 minimum
2. **Frame Rate**: 30fps is fine, 60fps if possible
3. **Zoom**: Use browser zoom at 125% for better visibility
4. **Cursor**: Highlight cursor movements (optional)
5. **Transitions**: Smooth transitions between pages (no jarring cuts)

### For Voiceover:
1. **Script**: Read naturally, don't sound robotic
2. **Pacing**: Slightly slower than normal conversation
3. **Energy**: Maintain enthusiasm throughout
4. **Pauses**: Brief pauses for emphasis
5. **Background Music**: Keep it subtle if used

### For Editing:
1. **Cuts**: Quick cuts keep energy high
2. **Text Overlays**: Use sparingly, only for emphasis
3. **Transitions**: Simple fades or cuts work best
4. **Color Grading**: Keep it clean and professional
5. **Audio**: Remove background noise, normalize levels
