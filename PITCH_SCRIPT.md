# Evergreen Capital - Hackathon Pitch Script
## 1-3 Minute Video Presentation

## [0:00 - 0:15] HOOK & PROBLEM

**[Screen: Title card - "Evergreen Capital"]**

**Speaker:**
"Imagine if you could invest in prediction markets, but instead of making decisions yourself, you had a team of AI experts analyzing every bet for you. That's Evergreen Capital."

**[Screen: Show dashboard with AI agents]**

"Traditional prediction market investing requires constant research, market analysis, and emotional decision-making. Most people don't have the time or expertise to consistently win."

## [0:15 - 0:45] SOLUTION & INNOVATION

**[Screen: Show multi-agent system diagram]**

**Speaker:**
"Evergreen Capital solves this by deploying five specialized AI agents that work together like a real hedge fund team:

- Our **Quant Analyst** crunches the numbers and identifies patterns
- The **Risk Manager** ensures we never overexpose the portfolio
- The **Market Maker** analyzes liquidity and execution
- Our **News Analyst** tracks sentiment and catalysts
- And the **Arbitrage Analyst** finds cross-market opportunities"

**[Screen: Show governance voting interface]**

"These agents debate each proposal, vote YES or NO, and only approved trades get executed. You, as a vault participant, can see every decision, every debateS"

## [0:45 - 1:30] KEY FEATURES & TECH

**[Screen: Show live dashboard with portfolio, charts, positions]**

**Speaker:**
"Here's what makes Evergreen Capital unique:

**First, it's fully transparent.** Every AI decision, every debate transcript, every trade is visible on-chain and in our dashboard.

**Second, it's decentralized.** Built on Solana, your funds are in a smart contract vault. No central authority controls your money.

**Third, it's intelligent.** Our agents pull real-time data from Polymarket, analyze historical patterns, and make data-driven decisions 24/7.

**And fourth, it's accessible.** Anyone can deposit SOL, receive vault shares, and participate in the fund's performance."

**[Navigate to Open Positions]**
"These are our active positions. You can see exactly what we're betting on, how much, and the potential payouts."
